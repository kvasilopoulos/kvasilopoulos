## Kostas Vasilopoulos 

🚀 Used to model economic crises, now engineering AI to cause them 🦾🤖!

📈 From modelling housing markets to optimizing LLM pipelines at scale.

⚡ Merging MLOps, NLP, and GenAI into production-ready solutions.

## 🔥 What I Do

* AI/ML Engineering – Deploying models that don’t just work but actually scale.
* MLOps & Infrastructure – Because AI without orchestration is just a fancy script.
* NLP & GenAI – Making sense of text, one token at a time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

🐍 Python | 📊 R | ☁️ AWS | 🐳 Docker | ☸️ Kubernetes | 🦜 LangChain | 🔍 ElasticSearch

## 🎯  Academic Life

* Ph.D. in Economics 🎓 (Lancaster University) – because data without context is just noise.
* Once turned housing market data into journal-worthy insights. Now turning ML models into business value.
