### Hi there 👋

🚀 Used to model economic crises, now engineering AI to prevent them.
📈 From modelling housing markets to optimizing LLM pipelines at scale.
⚡ Merging MLOps, NLP, and GenAI into production-ready solutions.

🔥 What I Do
AI/ML Engineering – Deploying models that don’t just work but actually scale.
MLOps & Infrastructure – Because AI without orchestration is just a fancy script.
NLP & GenAI – Making sense of text, one token at a time.
Ethical AI – Built EthicaraML for Pfizer to keep AI on the right side of history.
🛠️ Tech Stack
🐍 Python | ☁️ AWS | 🐳 Docker | ☸️ Kubernetes | 🦜 LangChain | 🔥 PySpark | 🔍 ElasticSearch

🎯 Past Life
Ph.D. in Economics 🎓 (Lancaster University) – because data without context is just noise.
Once turned housing market data into journal-worthy insights. Now turning ML models into business value.
