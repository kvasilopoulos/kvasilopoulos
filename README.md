## Kostas Vasilopoulos

I started out modeling economic systems and financial crises. Today, I design and operate AI and ML systems used in production environments.

My work focuses on taking models from research to reality — building scalable, reliable ML and GenAI platforms that teams can actually depend on.

## What I work on

- **AI / ML Engineering** – Designing, deploying, and operating machine learning systems at scale  
- **MLOps & Infrastructure** – Production pipelines, observability, reliability, and cost-aware scaling  
- **NLP & GenAI** – Text analytics, LLM-based systems, and applied language models

## Tech stack

Python · R · AWS · Docker · Kubernetes · LangChain · Elasticsearch

## Background

- **Ph.D. in Economics** (Lancaster University)  
- Early work focused on housing markets and macroeconomic modeling  
- Current focus is on applying ML and GenAI to real-world, production problems
